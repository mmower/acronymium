# Acronymium

A Clojure program that can generate acronyms according to a set of rules specifying the words
 to use in different categories and whether a category is required or optional.

## Usage

Take a look at core-test.

Load in a REPL, define some rules using the parser.

    (require '[acronymium.core :refer [acronyms]]
              [acronymium.parser :refer [parse-ruleset]])
              
    (def ruleset (parse-ruleset "+Ham Bacon Sausage
                                 +Tomatoes Mushrooms
                                 *Waffles Chips
                                 *Eggs
                                 *Beans Ketchup
                                 *Tea Coffee"))
    (acronyms ruleset "hem")
    => (["Ham" "Eggs" "Mushrooms"])
    (acronyms ruleset "bet")
    => (["Bacon" "Eggs" "Tomatoes"])
    (acronyms ruleset "wet")
    => ()
    
Now feed a dictionary to `acronyms` and find words you like with
a meaningful acronym.

    (def dict (load-dict "/usr/share/dict/words"))
    (def adict (acro-dict ruleset dict))
    adict
    =>
    {"TECH" (["Tomatoes" "Eggs" "Chips" "Ham"] ["Tomatoes" "Eggs" "Coffee" "Ham"]),
